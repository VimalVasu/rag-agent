# Using SteadyPilot

Daily
- Start with `@dailystart`
- Run `@numbers` before merging any PR
- Log a 20–40s demo clip at day end

Weekly
- Keep triad: RAG + Agent + Eval/Ops
- Friday: `@friday` to compile demo, deltas, learnings, next bottleneck

Backlog Hygiene
- Add every idea, then `@triage` to keep WIP ≤ 2
- Use `@rescope` whenever a task exceeds 2 days

Interview Prep
- `@jobpack` to format artifacts + talking points
